1
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:30,383
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,717
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:34,508
Excuse me. Coming through.

4
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,342
<i>Tonight, so-called</i>
<i>magician Lionel shrike</i>

5
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,842
<i>is making another sad</i>
<i>attempt for attention</i>

6
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:44,383
<i>by performing what he calls</i>
<i>an impossible feat.</i>

7
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:47,717
<i>The safe is made of</i>
<i>the strongest iron.</i>

8
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:50,883
<i>It can't be sawed</i>
<i>through or pried.</i>

9
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:55,383
<i>Yet, Lionel shrike thinks</i>
<i>he's able to escape.</i>

10
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:57,342
Dad! Dad!

11
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,050
Hey, buddy.

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,925
You made it, huh?

13
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,508
Now, see that seat there?

14
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:11,383
Is Lionel shrike
the kind of magician
who can pull this off?

15
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:14,383
<i>Or is he actually</i>
<i>in over his head?</i>

16
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,883
We'll see about that.

17
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,050
What's the matter?

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,425
I don't want you to go.

19
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,633
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

20
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,925
Remember?
This is what I do.

21
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,592
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

22
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:28,508
Okay? Besides...

23
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:31,592
I always keep
something up my sleeve.

24
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,717
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

25
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,383
Okay. How many seconds?

26
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:37,842
300.

27
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:39,508
300. Maybe a few less.

28
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:43,550
Mmm.

29
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,342
I love you so much.

30
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,883
Okay.
See you later, big man.

31
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:54,675
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>- Lionel shrike!</i>

32
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,300
Will he be able
to hold his breath?

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,925
<i>Will he be able to</i>
<i>somehow escape the safe?</i>

34
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,675
Three, two, one...

35
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,550
Two, three,

36
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,050
four, five, six,
seven, eight...

37
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,050
296...

38
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,342
297, 298, 299, 300.

39
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,383
303, 304...

40
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:35,467
<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

41
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:41,508
<i>and we have not</i>
<i>seen or heard anything</i>
<i>from Lionel shrike yet.</i>

42
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,717
Move!

43
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,050
Dad!

44
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:48,883
Dad! Dad!

45
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,300
Let go of me!

46
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:54,342
Dad!

47
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,592
No! Dad!

48
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:00,508
Dad! Let go!
